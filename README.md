# Astro Basics

![just-the-basics](https://github.com/withastro/astro/assets/2244813/a0a5533c-a856-4198-8470-2d67b1d7c554)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
|:--------------------------| :----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`            | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm dev`                | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm build`              | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`            | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `pnpm astro ...`          | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `pnpm astro -- --help`    | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
